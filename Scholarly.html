            <h2><span>1. </span>Purpose </h2>
            <p>
                I created a graphical interface for an application that helps students who wants to prepare for exams.

            <h2><span>2. </span>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Nowadays, many children do not understand the subjects that they are taught in educational institutions due to their entourage, lack of motivation and the inability of some teachers to teach. Some students seek the help of a meditative teacher,
                but a lot of them cannot afford it.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are the main reasons why I created an application to solve this problem. It is a free of charge app, available on the web, that contains videos which will help students learn, exercises that will help them develop their knowledge and a set of tests
                that will help them evaluate what they have learned ongoing.
            </p>

            <p>
                The application starts with the home page, from where the user can log in or create an account. After the authentication, he is redirected to the profile page, where he can choose the domain that he wants to study. After choosing it the user will be redirected
                to a page where he can choose from learning, exercisesing or testing the knowledge that he aquired in that certain domain that he previously choosed. <br>
